# The following is a parametrization method developed for heterogenously degraded regions within Li-ion batteries. It consist of a 2D physical model implemented in COMSOL Multyphysics combined with a parameters optimization algorithm DFO-LS (Derivative-Free Optimizer for Least-Squares Minimization) [1] developed in python.
