# noubal_comsol

The following is a parametrization method developed for interpreting heterogenously degraded regions within Li-ion batteries. It consist of a 2D physical model implemented in COMSOL Multyphysics combined with a parameters optimization algorithm DFO-LS (Derivative-Free Optimizer for Least-Squares Minimization) [1] developed in python. The MPh [2] interface is used for running the COMSOL code with python.
